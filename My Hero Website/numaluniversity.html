    <h1>Numal college</h1>
	<p>Numal College is in Rikhi in District Mianwali, Punjab, Pakistan. It is an associate college of the University of Bradford. The college is on Talagang Mianwali Road very near Namal Lake. The 40 kanal land for this college was provided by Ghulam Muhammad 'Seelu', a local resident. The University of Bradford's latest chancellor, the former cricketer Imran Khan, has set up links between the university and Namal College; the move is expected to build links between Bradford, which has a relatively high proportion of Pakistani students, and Pakistan. It is Khan's first act as chancellor after being appointed to the position in early 2006.The college was inaugurated by Syed Yousaf Raza Gillani, the prime minister of Pakistan, on April 27, 2008. University of Bradford has worked closely with Namal College in designing the courses and curriculum, ensuring quality assurance, training and development for the faculty and advising on matters related to academic administration.
       There are more than 300 students studying for University of Bradford degrees at Namal College and more than 90% of these students are on financial support.
       The second phase of construction is expected to begin shortly and will include on-campus faculty and student accommodation premises and research laboratories. The Namal Education Foundation (NEF) owns 1000 acres of land and is all set for building a knowledge city in Pakistan. Imran Khan is the chairman of the Board of Governors Namal Education Foundation, which is the sponsoring body of Namal Knowledge City. As a philanthropist, Imran has undertaken initiatives to address the economic and social challenges faced by the area. These challenges include improvements in literacy, community organization, health, access to credit, encouragement of corporate investment, and education. This college offers two four-year degree programs namely B. Sc. (HONS) Computer Sciences and B. Eng. Electrical & Electronics. Although new to the field of technical higher education in Pakistan, the college aims to become at par with the best colleges and universities in the world.

     Namal College, Mianwali has the honor of being the only college in Pakistan to offer a foreign degree. It is an associate college of University of Bradford and therefore each graduating student receives the same degree that a U.o.B. graduate would receive. While the same degree from the UK could cost the student in Pakistani rupees around Rs. 10,000,000 the same can be had from Namal College for Rs. 1,000,000.
