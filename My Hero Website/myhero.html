    <p>The influence of Imran Khan in Pakistan is higher than any other person. He has done a lot for Pakistan as a cricketer, humanitarian and now serving as a changed politician as well.

		<h2>As Cricketer:</h2>

		<p>Cricket is not national sport of Pakistan but if it has become an iconic thing, Imran Khan has huge contribution in it. Imran Khan introduced the fast bowling cult which is everlasting. He became one of the finest allrounder of cricket to till date. Winning WC in 1992 is one of his biggest cricket achievement. He introduced world class players like Wasim Akram, Inzamam ul Haq and Waqar Younis who continued his legacy. Every Pakistani who loves cricket, can't hate Imran Khan.</p>

		<h2>As Humanitarian:</h2>

		<p>Imran Khan lost his mother in 1985 due to cancer. This changed his as a person and cancer hospital became his prime purpose in life. He went to every town of Pakistan in order to raise funds for cancer hospital. You would be amazed that he receive massive support from Indians in UK and other parts of the world in order to raise funds. Lady Diana, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Amitath Bachan and Aamir Khan were vital figures in fund raising and also big fans of Imran Khan. In 1994, first cancer hospital was inaugurated in Lahore and now by the grace of Allah, there are two other cancer hospital working in Peshawar and Karachi. There are reports that Imran Khan will consider to have another cancer hospital in Quetta.</p>

		<h2>As Politician:</h2>

		<p>Imran Khan started his political career in 95 to 96 under the platform of Pakistan Threek e Insaaf (Pakistan Justice Movement is meaning of his party name). Pakistan Muslim League and Pakistan Peoples Party are established parties therefore he did not received positive response. Despite all challenges, he did not gave up and continued to strive for political reforms in Pakistan. He is probably the only Pakistani politician whose party motto is fight against injustice and corruption. I admit PTI has yet to do a lot to come in power but Imran Khan is inspiration of Pakistani Youth.
