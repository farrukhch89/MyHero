    <p>Imran Khan HI, PP, RCPE (Hon), ASY, WCY  born Imran Khan Niazi on 25 November 1952, in Lahore is a Pakistani politician, the 22nd Prime Minister of Pakistan, celebrity, and former cricketer.  He played international cricket for two decades in the late twentieth century and, after retiring, entered politics. Besides his political activism, Khan is also a philanthropist, cricket commentator, Chancellor of the University of Bradford and Founding Chairman of Board of Governors of Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital & Research Centre. Through worldwide fundraising, he founded Namal College, Mianwali in 2008.
       He was Pakistan's most successful cricket captain, leading his country to victory at the 1992 Cricket World Cup, playing for the Pakistani cricket team from 1971 to 1992, and serving as its captain intermittently throughout 1982–1992. After retiring from cricket at the end of the 1987 World Cup in 1988, owing to popular demand he was requested to come back by the president of Pakistan Zia ul Haq to lead the team once again. At the age of 39, Khan led his team to Pakistan's first and only World Cup victory in 1992. With 3807 runs and 362 wickets in Test cricket, he is one of eight world cricketers to have achieved an 'All-rounder's Triple' in Test matches. On 14 July 2010, Khan was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.
       In April 1996, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ("Movement for Justice") political party was established and Khan became its chairman.</p>

	<blockquote>"The notable exception to that US influence, however, is the former cricketer Imran Khan, who delivered a long lecture to visiting US politicians about the iniquities of US policy.</blockquote>
					
    <p>Welcoming the group at his grand home outside Islamabad, Khan hosted an "hour-long, largely one-sided, and somewhat uncomfortable conversation".
       To defeat the Taliban the US had to understand the "tribal character" of the militants, he said, and described the Pakistani drive against the Taliban in 2009 as "stage-managed" for US consumption."
	   He represented Mianwali as a member of the National Assembly from November 2002 to October 2007, he was again elected on 11 May 2013, while his party gained 35 seats in the National Assembly. Global Post mentioned him third in a list of nine world leaders of 2012 and recognized Khan as the face of anti-drone movement in Pakistan. According to Asia Society, Khan was voted as Asia’s Person of the Year 2012. As the Pew Research Center, in 2012 majority of Pakistani respondents offered a favorable opinion of Khan, the survey also revealed Khan's popularity among youth. </p>
