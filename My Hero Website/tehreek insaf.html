	<h1 id="heading1">History Of Tehreek Insaaf</h1>
	<p>The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf commonly known as PTI (Pakistan Movement for Justice) is a centrist, nationalist and communitarian political party in Pakistan, which was founded by former Pakistani cricket captain and philanthropist Imran Khan. The party is an anti-status quo movement advocating for an egalitarian and modern model of Islamic democratic welfare state. It is the fastest growing political party in Pakistan.The PTI claims to be the only non-family party of mainstream Pakistani politics.With over 10 million members in Pakistan and abroad it is claimed to be Pakistan's largest party by membership. According to 2013 elections results PTI is Pakistan's close third largest party, second largest in Punjab and Karachi while largest in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. It received the second largest popular vote in the country, with a little over 7.5 million people voting for it on the election day. It also leads a coalition government in the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

	<h2 id="heading2">Policies</h2>
	
	<h3>Social</h3>
	<p>As a revolutionary party that has recently arrived on the national stage, the PTI has called for major social, economic, and political reforms. The PTI's ideology is derived mainly from Allama Iqbal's vision of a self-reliant, modern democracy derived from the guiding principles inherent in Islam. While Pakistan receives a large amount of money from international lenders and aid donors, the PTI has promised to stop all foreign aid if it comes to power.The PTI maintains that corruption in all of its forms – whether moral, financial, spiritual – has ruined Pakistan, and therefore a culture of accountability and transparency is needed to restore faith in the system of government.The PTI has robustly argued for religious tolerance and greater representation for minorities. A number of Christians, Sikhs, and Hindus have joined the PTI. Besides minorities, the PTI has also spoken out for the plight of senior citizens, poor people, and women.
	</p>
	<h3>Education</h3>
	<p>PTI believes in raising education standards across the country, launching a strong campaign to achieve universal literacy, and promoting schools and colleges in the nation. On 20 February 2013 PTI launched its 'Education Policy with plans to introduce uniform education system with one curricula for all and provision of education in mother tongue and Urdu language for primary levels. English being an international language cannot be ignored, but it would be taught as a subject and not as a cultural imperialism, as it triggered wide cultural and societal divisions in the country.PTI believes in de-politicization and de-centralization of all educational institutes to the basic town level. Party would like to give special focus to adult literacy from the age of 15-to-30 and invest resources to provide functional literacy to them. The PTI believes that a focus should be placed upon the education of women.                   </p>
	<h3>Political</h3>
	<p>The PTI has called for a complete overhaul of Pakistan's current political order The PTI believes in a complete abolition of feudalism, economic inequality,and an end to government mismanagement. The PTI has promised to crack down on police brutality, restructure the civil service, reform the electoral system, allow for a truly independent judiciary, decentralise state power, and enforce all laws which extend personal liberty.
   </p>
	<h3>Military</h3>
	<p>The PTI propose civilian supremacy over Pakistan's military. The armed forces would be under complete civilian control, the ISI would report directly to the Prime Minister of Pakistan, and the defence budget would be audited by the government. Imran Khan also pledged to resign should any terrorism take place from Pakistani soil following these reforms.[28][29][30]
      </p>
	<h1>Drone Bombings</h1>
	<p>Pakistan Tehrik-e-Insaaf organised a protest against drone attacks in Pakistan on 23 November 2013 at Peshawar, where it called on the federal government to force an end to U.S. CIA drone attacks and to block NATO supplies through the country to Afghanistan. "We will put pressure on America, and our protest will continue if drone attacks are not stopped." The U.S. embassy declined to comment on the protest that also temporarily closed a route leading to one of two border crossings used for the shipments.[31]
       </p>
	<h3>Foreign Policy</h3>
     <p>The PTI believes in pursuing a foreign policy based on a nationalist agenda, which it believes will safeguard all of Pakistan's national interests and promote greater regional co-operation. The PTI would forge stronger relationships with neighbouring countries, but not at the cost of Pakistan's national sovereignty or territorial integrity.[32] The PTI would fully restore Pakistan's economic and political sovereignty if elected into power, and has consistently vilified the PPP-led federal government for subverting Pakistan's national interests and strategic ambitions to please international powers.[33]
          The PTI hopes to have a relationship with US that would be based on "self dignity and respect.The PTI will also stop all foreign aid to Pakistan.The PTI would make the Kashmir issue a top priority and would try and solve the issue permanently so that Pakistan no longer has any border or territorial disputes with any of its neighbours.    </p>
