	<h1 id="heading1">Imran Khan Background</h1>
	<p>Imran Khan was born in Lahore into a family of Pashtun origin, the only son of Ikramullah Khan Niazi, a civil engineer, and his wife Shaukat Khanum. Long settled in Mianwali in northwestern Punjab, the family are of Pashtun ethnicity and belong to the Niazi Shermankhel tribe.Niazi is a branch of Lohani pashtuns.A quiet and shy boy in his youth, Khan grew up with his four sisters in relatively affluent (upper middle-class) circumstances and received a privileged education. He was educated at Aitchison College in Lahore, the Royal Grammar School Worcester in England, where he excelled at cricket, and in 1972 he enrolled to study Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Keble College, Oxford, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts.
       Khan's mother hailed from the Burki family which had produced several successful cricketers, including such household names as cricketers Javed Burki, Majid Khan and, paternally (from the Niazi tribe then), to Misbah-ul-Haq.
       Outside cricket, from his mother's side, he's also a descendant of the Sufi warrior-poet and inventor of the Pashto alphabet, Pir Roshan, who hailed from his maternal family's ancestral Kaniguram town in South Waziristan, and a cousin to one of Pakistan's leading English-language columnist, Khaled Ahmed.
       On 16 May 1995, Khan married Jemima Goldsmith, in a two-minute ceremony conducted in Urdu in Paris. A month later, on 21 June, they were married again in a civil ceremony at the Richmond registry office in England. Jemima was converted to Islam. Khan's later decision to join politics alarmed opposition politicians and intelligence agencies mainly because of Jemima's half Jewish ancestry, this became point of criticism especially by Islamic parties who alleged that he was related to 'Zionists'. The couple has two sons, Sulaiman Isa and Kasim.
       Rumours circulated that the couple's marriage was in crisis, Jemima denied that publishing an advertisement in Pakistani newspapers. On 22 June 2004, it was announced that the Khans had divorced, ending the nine-year marriage because it was "difficult for Jemima to adapt to life in Pakistan". The marriage ended. Khan now resides alone in Bani Gala farmhouse.In November 2009, Khan underwent emergency surgery at Lahore's Shaukat Khanum Cancer Hospital to remove an obstruction in his small intestine.

	<h3 id="heading3">Marriage life</h3>
	<p>Jemima married Imran Khan, a Pakistani cricketer, celebrity and philanthropist who later turned to politics, on 16 May 1995 in a traditional Islamic ceremony in Paris. They also had a civil ceremony on 21 June 1995 at the Richmond Register Office, followed by a midsummer ball at Ormeley Lodge. A few months before her wedding, she converted to Islam, citing the writings of Muhammad Asad, Charles le Gai Eaton and Alija Izetbegović as her influences. In Lahore, Pakistan, she learned to speak Urdu and also wore traditional Pakistani clothes. Diana, Princess of Wales, was a close friend of Jemima, who visited her in Lahore, Pakistan in 1996.
She wrote in her 2008 article for The Times that she "over-conformed in her eagerness to be accepted" into the "new and radically different culture" of Pakistan. In 2003, she received her MA in Middle Eastern Studies at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, focusing on Modern Trends in Islam.
Khan stated that prior to her conversion to Islam, she was technically Anglican but "was made familiar with Jewish traditions", since her paternal grandfather Frank Goldsmith was German Jewish.During her marriage, her Jewish heritage was used by Imran Khan's political opponents to question their credibility in Pakistani politics, especially concerning accusations that they supported the Jewish Lobby.
In 1998, Khan launched an eponymous fashion label that employed poor Pakistani women to embroider western clothes with eastern handiwork to be sold in London and New York.Profits were donated to her husband's Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital. She ran the organization until December 2001, when she shut down the business due to the economic situation following the September 11 attacks, and so she could focus on fundraising and on supporting her husband in Pakistani politics. She established the Jemima Khan Afghan Refugee Appeal to provide tents, clothing, food, and healthcare for Afghan refugees at Jalozai camp in Peshawar.
In 1999, Khan was charged in Pakistan with illegally exporting Islamic era antique tiles. She claimed that the charge was a fabrication to harass and damage her husband, but nevertheless, left Pakistan to stay with her mother for fear of incarceration.After General Pervez Musharraf overthrew elected Prime Minister Navaz Sharif in a coup d'état, in 2000, the Ministry of Culture and Archaeology verified the tiles were not antiques, and the Pakistani court dropped the charges, allowing her to return to Lahore.
Khan became an Ambassador for UNICEF UK in 2001, and went on field trips to Kenya, Romania, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Pakistan, the last of which she later helped victims of the 2005 Kashmir earthquake by raising emergency funds. She has promoted UNICEF's Breastfeeding Manifesto, Growing Up Alone and End Child Exploitation campaigns in the UK.
Khan supported her husband as he became more involved in his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (a.k.a. "Justice Movement") party. Imran became a member of Pakistan's parliament in 2002 and has been a "vociferous critic of President Pervez Musharraf".
In 2003, Khan visited Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon, Jordan, the West Bank and Gaza to promote the charity Hope and Optimism for Palestinians In the Next Generation (HOPING).
Rumours circulated that the couple's marriage was in crisis, Jemima placed an advertisement in Pakistan newspapers to deny them. It read: "Whilst it is true that I am currently studying for a masters degree at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, it is certainly not true to say that Imran and I are having difficulties in our marriage. This is a temporary arrangement."  On 22 June 2004, it was announced that the Khans had divorced ending the nine-year marriage because it was "difficult for Jemima to adapt to life in Pakistan".The marriage ended amicably. Imran has said the six months leading to the divorce and the six months after was the hardest year of his life. After the divorce Jemima returned to Britain with the boys, according to the divorce settlement Khan's sons visit him in Pakistan during their school holidays while he stays with his former mother-in-law, Lady Annabel Goldsmith, when he comes to London to see them. According to Jemima, Imran and she have remained on good terms even after the divorce.</p>
<p>On 6 January 2015, Imran Khan confirmed his marriage to Reham Nayyar Khan, a Journalist, which ended on 30 October 2015 in a divorce.</p>
<p>Bushra Bibi is the wife of the 22nd Prime Minister of Pakistan Imran Khan, the current First Lady of Pakistan. Bushra is known for her connection to Sufi islam; prior to her marriage with Khan, she had been his spiritual mentor (murshid). Bushra married Imran Khan in 2018. </p>
